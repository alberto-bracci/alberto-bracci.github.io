	abstract = {Lack of regular physical or economic access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food is a critical issue affecting millions of people world-wide. Estimating how many and where these people are is of fundamental importance for governments and humanitarian organizations to take informed and timely decisions on relevant policies and programmes. In this study, we propose a machine learning approach to predict the prevalence of people with insufficient food consumption and of people using crisis or above crisis food-based coping when primary data is not available. Making use of a unique global data set, we show that the proposed models can explain up to 78\% of the variation in insufficient food consumption and crisis or above food-based coping levels. We also show that the proposed models can be used to nowcast the food security situation in near-real time and propose a method to identify which variables are driving the changes observed in predicted trends, which is key to make predictions serviceable to decision makers.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was conducted with resources provided by WFP thanks to its donors.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:IRB not required since this study is based on aggregated survey data.All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.
